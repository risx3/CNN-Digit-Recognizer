Learn computer vision fundamentals with the famous MNIST data

A digit recognizer is a program or model that is designed to identify handwritten digits and classify them into their respective numerical values (0-9).

This task is often accomplished using machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks, support vector machines, or decision trees. These models are trained on large datasets of labeled images of handwritten digits to learn how to recognize and classify them accurately.

Once trained, a digit recognizer can be used to automatically read and interpret handwritten digits on various documents, such as checks, forms, and handwritten notes. This technology has many practical applications, including in the banking and finance industries, where it can be used to automate the processing of checks and other financial documents.
